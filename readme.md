## Contribution Guidelines

### Folder and File Naming Convention

1. Create a folder with the name of your text art. This folder will contain all related files.

2. The main text art file should be named `art.txt`.

3. There is also a json file named `metadata.json`, which has following structure.
   
#### Metadata

Include a `metadata.json` file in your folder to provide essential information about your text art. Here's a template for the `metadata.json` file:

```json
{
  "artist": "Your Name",
  "width": "number of maximum character in a line",
  "height": "Number of lines",
  "characterCount": "number of total printable character",
  "description": "A brief description of your text art"
}
```
